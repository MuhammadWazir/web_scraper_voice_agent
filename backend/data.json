We’ll cover the exact plan and costs on a quick call so it’s tailored to you—want me to book it?\n\nQ: Do you have contract terms?\nA: There’s an initial three-month commitment; agreements auto-renew monthly with 30 days’ notice to cancel, and refunds aren’t offered for early termination. I can set a call to walk through terms and the rollout plan.\n\nOBJECTIONS\n\nObjection: We already have a dialer.\nResponse: Totally fine—most teams come to us from another dialer because they need higher pick-up and cleaner number health. Let’s do a quick comparison call with our specialist to see if the uplift is worth it for you.\n\nObjection: I’m worried about spam flags and call deliverability.\nResponse: That’s exactly what our SMART Dialing and telco partnerships were built to solve, with real-time spam monitoring, local presence, and branded caller ID. I can book you with our specialist to review your current caller IDs and show the plan.\n\nObjection: We’re a small team—this might be overkill.\nResponse: We tailor the setup for small teams and focus on meaningful connects, not just more dials. Give us 15 minutes with our specialist and we’ll show a right-sized plan.\n\nObjection: Does this replace our CRM?\nResponse: No—your CRM stays the source of truth; we integrate for real-time lead dialing and reporting. I can set a call so our specialist maps it to your exact CRM flow.\n\nObjection: Is this compliant with TCPA and call authentication?\nResponse: We align with TCPA best practices and educate on STIR/SHAKEN and attestation to keep calls trusted. Let’s book a quick consult to review your compliance needs and safeguards.\n\nObjection: What if the system goes down?\nResponse: We adhere to a 99.9% uptime SLA, though no service can promise uninterrupted uptime, and we provide transparent reporting. Our specialist can walk you through reliability and failover on a short call—want me to book it?\n\nObjection: The pricing/commitment makes me nervous.\nResponse: We customise plans to your goals; initial term is three months with monthly renewal, and we’ll only scope what you need. Let’s jump on a quick call to size it right and cover costs clearly.\n\nObjection: We tried tools like this and didn’t see results.\nResponse: The difference is our number reputation management, telco alignment, and cadence tuning that drives 15–30% pick-up for many teams. Give us 15 minutes with our specialist to review your past setup and show what we’d do differently.",

Sound good?\n[wait for response]\nCharlotte: [repeat back any final note] Perfect. Talk then.\n\nIf they ask about cost:\nCharlotte: Totally fair. Budget matters. Most teams start small for 3 months and only expand if they see more live calls in week 1-2. The plan depends on seats and volume, plus usage. To see if it’s even worth it, want that 15-min plan?

You can customize, reallocate licenses, and manage subscriptions flexibly.\n\nHow fast can we deploy, and what are the tech requirements?\nSetup is streamlined via the ELSA Portal; licenses must be assigned within two weeks of purchase or they auto-activate.

Is this more about customer calls, internal meetings, or interviews?\n[wait for response]\n[repeat back what they said] Got it. How many people need help first, and where are they based?\n[wait for response]\n[repeat back what they said] Makes sense. Quick story: a support team did short daily speaking drills.
